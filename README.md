# deltarune-dialog-speech-to-text
a speech to text in the form of a deltarune dialog box !

!!! YOU NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON AND PYGAME FOR THIS TO WORK !!!

python - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/

pygame - just run "pip3 install pygame" in console



hey guys, epic cool guy here.

so what this program is supposed to do is to turn speech from the microphone into the deltarune dialog box !

cool right? no? well too bad!

if you want to use it for recording videos/streaming make sure to chroma key out the pink and it should work fine :)

hotkeys for icons coming soon tm

TODO:
- line break automatically (done but not in a state i currently like, it will cut off words)
- little sound for the dialog per letter like in game (done)
- hotkeys to change icons (done)
- change sst to a better one, current one is kinda bad 
- polish
