# deltarune-dialog-speech-to-text
a speech to text in the form of a deltarune dialog box !

!!! YOU NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON AND SOME OTHER STUFF FOR THIS TO WORK !!!

python - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3010/ (im not sure how newer versions of python will work)

pip install commands:

pip install pygame
pip install vosk
pip install keyboard
pip install pyaudio



hey guys, epic cool guy here.

so what this program is supposed to do is to turn speech from the microphone into the deltarune dialog box !

cool right? no? well too bad!

if you want to use it for recording videos/streaming make sure to chroma key out the pink and it should work fine :)

hotkeys for icons coming soon tm

TODO:
- line break automatically (done but not in a state i currently like, it will cut off words)
- little sound for the dialog per letter like in game (done)
- hotkeys to change icons (done)
- change sst to a better one, current one is kinda bad 
- polish
