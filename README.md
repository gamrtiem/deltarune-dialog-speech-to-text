# deltarune-dialog-speech-to-text
a speech to text in the form of a deltarune dialog box !
hey guys, epic cool guy here.
so what this program is supposed to do is to turn speech from the microphone into the deltarune dialog box !
cool right? no? well too bad! 
if you want to use it for recording videos/streaming make sure to chroma key out the purple and it should work fine :)
hotkeys for icons coming tm
