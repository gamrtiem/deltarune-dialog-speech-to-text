# deltarune-dialog-speech-to-text
a speech to text in the form of a deltarune dialog box !
hey guys, epic cool guy here.\n
so what this program is supposed to do is to turn speech from the microphone into the deltarune dialog box !\n
cool right? no? well too bad! \n
if you want to use it for recording videos/streaming make sure to chroma key out the purple and it should work fine :) \n
